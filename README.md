iRules Syntax Highlighting for F5 Networks BIG-IP iRules syntax (http://devcentral.f5.com) for the Sublime Text Editor http://www.sublimetext.com

This was created from content found on DevCentral.

The command completion and syntax highlighting should be complete as of TMOS v11.5 including special highlighting for deprecated commands, functions, and events.

This bundle was updated on May 9th, 2014 and is currently maintained by Bill Church (https://github.com/billchurch/sublime-iRules).

Any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me.

The bulk of the TCL syntax highlighting was pulled from the TCL bundle by Kevin Ballard from TextMate.
