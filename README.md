# About

iRules Syntax Highlighting for F5 Networks BIG-IP iRules syntax (http://devcentral.f5.com) for the Sublime Text Editor http://www.sublimetext.com

The command completion and syntax highlighting should be complete as of TMOS v15.0 including special highlighting for deprecated commands, functions, and events. 

This bundle was updated on July 16, 2019 and is currently maintained by James Deucker (https://github.com/bitwisecook/sublime-iRules).

Any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me.

This bundle is created from both the built-in Tcl syntax by Sublime and the Visual Studio Code extension also by me (https://github.com/bitwisecook/vscode-iRule).

# Installation

# Notes
 * I don't yet understand how to properly control the completions so events only happen at when
 * I haven't yet figured out how to make it so `when` and `proc` can't nest
 * Many completions are missing
 * I haven't yet ported the code formatter
