# About

iRules Syntax Highlighting for F5 Networks BIG-IP iRules syntax (http://devcentral.f5.com) for the Sublime Text Editor http://www.sublimetext.com

This was created from content found on DevCentral.

The command completion and syntax highlighting should be complete as of TMOS v11.5 including special highlighting for deprecated commands, functions, and events.

This bundle was updated on May 9th, 2014 and is currently maintained by Bill Church (https://github.com/billchurch/sublime-iRules).

Any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me.

The bulk of the TCL syntax highlighting was pulled from the TCL bundle by Kevin Ballard from TextMate.

# Installation

Open a terminal and enter these two lines:
```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/

git clone https://github.com/billchurch/sublime-iRules
```

# Notes

I attempted to just copy my TextMate bundle over to Sublime, but it had some issues. I decided it was time to re-do this and update it.

I plan on adding more text snippets at a later date, when that is no man can say...
