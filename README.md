# About

iRules Syntax Highlighting for F5 Networks BIG-IP iRules syntax (http://devcentral.f5.com) for the Sublime Text Editor http://www.sublimetext.com

The command completion and syntax highlighting should be complete as of TMOS v15.0 including special highlighting for deprecated commands, functions, and events. 

This bundle was updated on July 16, 2019 and is currently maintained by James Deucker (https://github.com/bitwisecook/sublime-iRules).

Any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me.

This bundle is created from the Visual Studio Code extension also by me (https://github.com/bitwisecook/vscode-iRule).

# Installation



# Notes

I attempted to just copy my TextMate bundle over to Sublime, but it had some issues. I decided it was time to re-do this and update it.

I plan on adding more text snippets at a later date, when that is no man can say...
